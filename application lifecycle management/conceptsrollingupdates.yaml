Rollout and Revision
When first deployment was created new rollout will be created which will create a new Revision
when there is any update in application was made new rollout and revision will be created

So This will helps in keep tracking of updates to application and quicky rollback if we want to revert changes.

Check the status of rollout
k rollout status <name of deployment>
To see the revisions and history of rollout
k rollout history <name of deployment>
Deployment strategies:
  recreate and Rolling update

Rolling update is the default deployment stategy.

Recreate strategy will bring down all pods at a time and then bring up the pods with updates.
Rolling update will bring one pod down and then one pod up, so that application will not be down at any time.
