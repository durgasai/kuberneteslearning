Readiness Probe
even when the pod is in ready state, it might take an addditional 10 to bring up application.
instead of service depending on state of pod for routing we will be setting up appllication specific health checks
Liveness Probe
everytime when there is any issue with application kubernetes will try to restart the container,
we can define liveness probe to identify if it is getting restart because of some application related bugs

we can specify in the spe section

livenessProbe: # to check if it can get response on web page over api
  httpGet:
    path: /api/healty
    port: 8080

livenessProbe: # to check if it can listen over port 3306
  tcpSocket:
    port: 3306

livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
      - cat
      - /app/is_healthy

we can also have other properties
initialDelaySeconds: 10 if we are sure that application might take 10 sec to warmup
periodSeconds: 5 How frequently I need to do probe on application
faultThreshold: 8 in order to increase failure attempts.

both configurations are same only liveness and readiness will change
