CMD ENTRYPOINT

CMD - defines the process to be run when the container starts.
1. if we append a command that need to be run during the run command that will overide the process that need to be run in the CMD instruction.
we can specify command as follows

CMD sleep 5
CMD ["sleep","5"]

command  line arguements will get appnded in the ENTRYPOINT instruction. where as arguements will get replaced when we use CMD instruction.
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]

both ENTRYPOINT and CMD in the docker file if we want to make default value for the ENTRYPOINT instruction . but both sould be written in JSON structure.

If we want modify the entry point command, then we can use
docker run --entrypoint <command> <image-name> <arguement>

when we use both CMD and entrypoint.
args section in kubernetes works like CMD in docker file, command section will works like entrypoint.
command: ["sleep2.0"] when you want to provide the command to run.
args: ["10"] when you want to provide arguements to the command.
