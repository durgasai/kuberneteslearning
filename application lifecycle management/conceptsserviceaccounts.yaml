service accounts are used for machines/application to authenticate to API server for getting information
for example
applications like jenkins to deploy applications to kubernetes it requires a service account

create a service account will generate a token and token will be stored in secret object and it will be associated with
the service account.

k create serviceaccount <serviceaccountname>

we can use the token to authenticate to API server.

if the application that need to use service account is hosted in kubernetes itself it is simple to configure token for application

it will simply mount the secrets which we can specify at the definition of the pod.
in the spec section we need to specify serviceAccount

when a cluster was created a service account with name default will be automatically created and any pod that was created
in the default namespace will have this sevice account secrets mounted.
inorder not mount automatically we have to specify
automountServiceAccountToken: false
