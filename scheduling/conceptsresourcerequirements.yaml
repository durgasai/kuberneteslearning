cpu and memory are the two things that will define resource requirements.
there are requests(min required resources for the container) and limits (max resources for the container)
By default
requests
cpu 0.5
Mem 256 Mi
limits
cpu 1
Mem 512 Mi

we can specify explicitly by defining in pod definition file in spec section

resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 1
    memory: "1Gi"
  limits:
    cpu: 2
    memory: "2Gi"
