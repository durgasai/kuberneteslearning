Node selectors are used to set limitations on pod to run only on certain nodes.
We will be specifying them in spec section of pod definition file.
nodeSelector:
  size: large
Before specifying in the pod definition file we need to add label to the node
k label nodes node01 size=large

If we have any complex restrictions for pods something like pod can be placed in nodes of size large or medium.
we have to use Node Affinity.

affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExperession:
            - key: kubernetes.io/e2e-az-name
              operator: In
              values:
                - e2e-az1
                - e2e-az2

operators we can use are In, NotIn
we can use Exists operator to verify whether the key exists even before comparing the value.

NodeAffinitytypes

there are two phases in pod DuringScheduling and DuringExecuion
DuringScheduling phase is when the pod is creating for the first time and that doesn't exist.
DuringExecution phase is when pod exists and some modifications were done for the nodes such as
changing the label or modifying the label.

DuringScheduling
Required node with label should be available inorder to schedule the pod
Preferred node with label should be available inorder to schedule the pod, if not available pod will be
   scheduled in other available nodes.

DuringExecution
Ignonred if any updates were done to labels for nodes(modification to labels or removing the lables) pods will
  continued to run once scheduled.
Required if any updates were done to labels for nodes(modification to labels or removing the lables) pods will
  be evicted from the node if node affinity rules were not met.
