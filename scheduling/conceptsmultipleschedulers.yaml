Instead of using default scheduler, we can also use custom scheduler with own scheduling algorithm.
We can create another scheduler service by giving --scheduler-name=mycustomscheduler
While setting up using Kubeadm tool, since it will provision kubescheduler as pod, we will be creating a custom
scheduler as another pod. we can just take the copy of default scheduler file and add following
--scheduler-name=mycustomscheduler
--leader-elect=true
--lock-object-name=mycustomscheduler
last two are required when we need to deploy HA kubernetes cluster.
in the pod definition file in the spec section specify the new scheduler name
schedulerName: mycustomscheduler

Copy kube-scheduler.yaml from the directory /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
to any other location and then change the name to my-scheduler.
Here, we are setting leader-elect to false for our new custom scheduler called my-scheduler.

We are also making use of a different port 10282 which is not currently in use in the controlplane.

The default scheduler uses secure-port on port 10259 to serve HTTPS with authentication and authorization.
This is not needed for our custom scheduler, so we can disable HTTPS by setting the value of secure-port to 0.


Finally, because we have set secure-port to 0, replace HTTPS with HTTP and use the correct ports under liveness and startup probes
