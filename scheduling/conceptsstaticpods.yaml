Pods that were created by the kubelet without using API server are called static pods
/etc/kubernetes/manifests is the directory where we wil place static pods
we can specify the path directtly in the kubelet service or by specifyng the path to manifes directory

1. --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests
2. --config=kubeconfig.yaml
 in the kubeconfig.yaml staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests

we can view static pods by docker ps, since there is no kube api server we can't kubectl.

After setting up static pods this can also be known to kube apiserver and they can be only in readonly mode.
they can be suffuxed by nodename.

Static pods helps in setting up kubernetes controlplane objects. Kubeadm uses this approach to setup cluster.


  Identify which node the static pod is created on, ssh to the node and delete the pod definition file.
  If you don't know the IP of the node, run the kubectl get nodes -o wide command and identify the IP.
  Then, SSH to the node using that IP. For static pod manifest path look at the file /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml.
