What we need to monitor in kubernetes?
1. How many nodes are present?
2. How many pods are present?
3. Performance metrics like Cpu utilization, Mem utilization, Disk utilization.
There were number of third party tools such as Metric server, Prometheous, Elastic search, Datadog, dynatrace.
once we install them as a pod, they will collect all the information reg nodes and pods.
How metrics server can able to get the logs?
Kubelet containes a component CAdvisor retreive the performance metrics of pods and expose them to kube api server which
will make them available to metric server
metric server is in-memory logging solution, it can't give historical performances, we need to go advanced tools for those.
